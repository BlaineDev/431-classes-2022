## Announcements

1. There is a [Minute Paper after Class 14](https://bit.ly/431-2022-min-14), due Wednesday 2022-10-19 at Noon.
2. The status of Project A Proposals [is available here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2022/blob/main/projectA/proposal_status.md).
    - To ease the transition to the final version of the project (including Analyses) I have created a [Sample Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/exampleC.html) and then reproduced it using four different themes. I suggest the use of one of these documents as your starting point for the final report due 2022-10-31. If you've already done the proposal successfully, the minor rearrangement here should be easy to accomplish, and will make our evaluation much easier. Also, you have the option to try out three different themes (in addition to the `readthedown` most of you used on the proposal.
    - Among other adjustments, this new [Sample Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/exampleC.html) provides you code to generate a codebook I'd be completely satisfied with.
3. [Lab 04](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2022) is due Monday 2022-10-24 at 9 PM, but you can do it now, if you like. 
    - Remember CWRU's Fall Break is next Monday and Tuesday, so we won't have class on Tuesday 2022-10-25.
4. Today's data sets come from the [Cleveland Clinic Statistical Education Dataset Repository](https://www.lerner.ccf.org/qhs/datasets/) and you can [register there](https://www.lerner.ccf.org/qhs/datasets/) to download the [two data sets we'll use](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2022/tree/main/class14/data) if you like. Registration is fast and free.
    - Just a note for November: In Project B, you cannot use that repository as a source of project data.
5. Chapter 32 is now part of the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/).

## One Last Thing

A great resource for news and opinions on data analysis, statistical modeling and many related topics is Frank Harrell's [Statistical Thinking News](https://paper.li/stn) to which I subscribe (it's free and weekly). The most recent issue includes:

- [How to Do Bad Biomarker Research](http://hbiostat.org/blog/post/badb/) from Frank's [blog on Statistical Thinking](http://hbiostat.org/blog/)
- Retraction Watch on [In 1987, the NIH found a paper contained fake data. It was just retracted.](https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/13/in-1987-the-nih-found-a-paper-contained-fake-data-it-was-just-retracted/)
- [Screening Colonoscopy Misses the Mark in its First Real Test](https://sensiblemed.substack.com/p/screening-colonoscopy-misses-the), a commentary by John Mandrola and Vinay Prasad at Sensible Medicine describing the NordICC Trial's results. This was the first randomized trial of screening colonoscopy.

## Dr. Love is in a musical, "Something Rotten", which runs October 28 through November 19

[Details are here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/theater#theater) and I've been told the show may eventually sell out. A recent update is that masks will **not** be required in the audience.
