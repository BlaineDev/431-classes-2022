## One Last Thing

A great resource for news and opinions on data analysis, statistical modeling and many related topics is Frank Harrell's [Statistical Thinking News](https://paper.li/stn) to which I subscribe (it's free and weekly). The most recent issue includes:

- [How to Do Bad Biomarker Research](http://hbiostat.org/blog/post/badb/) from Frank's [blog on Statistical Thinking](http://hbiostat.org/blog/)
- Retraction Watch on [In 1987, the NIH found a paper contained fake data. It was just retracted.](https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/13/in-1987-the-nih-found-a-paper-contained-fake-data-it-was-just-retracted/)
- [Screening Colonoscopy Misses the Mark in its First Real Test](https://sensiblemed.substack.com/p/screening-colonoscopy-misses-the), a commentary by John Mandrola and Vinay Prasad at Sensible Medicine describing the NordICC Trial's results. This was the first randomized trial of screening colonoscopy.
