## Announcements

1. I added the `mitml` package to our [list of recommended packages](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-packages) for installation. 
2. I also [upgraded my version of R](https://cran.case.edu/) to version 4.2.2 effective with today's slides, and updated all of my R packages.
3. I updated the Lab 7 Grading Rubric on our Shared Drive to account for the fact that Question 7 is worth 15, not 10 points.
4. **By class time** grades and feedback on Lab 7 will be posted to the [Course Grades Roster](https://bit.ly/431-grades-2022).
5. The [YouTube Playlist of your favorite songs](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1WkTI58HjchPCLLYcV3q48LluH5z8aeN) (and two of mine) is now available. This was a request as part of the [Project B checklist](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2022/checklist.html).
6. Grades and the answer sketch for Quiz 2 should be available by Noon on Thursday 2022-12-08.

## Remaining Tasks (other than Project B)

1. Our final Minute Paper (after Class 23) is due Wednesday 2022-12-07, and will be **posted by class time**.
2. (*optional*) [Lab X](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2022/blob/main/labX.md) is due Monday 2022-12-12 at Noon.
3. (*optional*) Should you want Dr. Love to regrade one (or more) of Labs 1-7, please be sure to fill out the [Lab Regrade Request Form](https://bit.ly/431-2022-lab-regrade-requests), which is also due Monday 2022-12-12 at Noon.

## Project B Tasks

1. Project B **presentations** will be held on December 8, 12, 13 and 15 according to [the schedule posted here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2022/blob/main/projectB/schedule.md). 
    - Read [the Checklist](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2022/checklist.html) well in advance to make sure you complete everything you need to do and are prepared for this Oral Presentation of Results properly.
    - Zoom information for the Project B presentations is now available in the Announcements section of [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/).
    - If you're presenting to me in person, bring a laptop with the HTML or Powerpoint you want to show to me during your presentation.
2. The Project B **final reports** for [Study 1](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2022/study1b.html) and for [Study 2](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2022/study2b.html) and the [self-evaluation form](https://bit.ly/431-2022-projectB-self-evaluation) are due at noon on Monday 2022-12-19. 
    - You should submit both your [Study 1 report](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2022/study1b.html) (Rmd and HTML) and your [Study 2 report](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2022/study2b.html) (Rmd and HTML) - so a total of four documents to Canvas by that time. 
    - If you are working with a partner, exactly one of you should submit these four items. The other person should submit a one-page note to Canvas (word or PDF is best) containing your name, and stating something like “I worked on Project B with [your partner’s name] and they will submit Project B for our group.”
    - If you are working with data other than NHANES data, you will also submit your data.
3. The [Self-Evaluation for Project B Form](https://bit.ly/431-2022-projectB-self-evaluation) should take about 15 minutes to complete. If you are working in a team, each of you need to complete the form as an individual. The Form should be completed after meeting with Dr. Love for your presentation **and** after submitting your final reports to Canvas.
