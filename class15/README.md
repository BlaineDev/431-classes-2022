## Announcements

1. Feedback from the Minute Paper after Class 14 should be available **by class time**.
2. The status of Project A Proposals [is available here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2022/blob/main/projectA/proposal_status.md).
    - To ease the transition to the final version of the project (including Analyses) I have created a [Sample Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/exampleC.html) and then reproduced it using four different themes. I **strongly** suggest using one of these documents to build your final report due 2022-10-31. 
3. Remember that Monday and Tuesday (10-24/25) are CWRU Fall Break, so our next class will be next Thursday 2022-10-27.

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. [Lab 04](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2022) is due Monday 2022-10-24 at 9 PM.
2. Read Spiegelhalter through Chapter 7 (How Sure Can We Be About What's Going On? Estimates and Intervals)
3. [Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/) due Monday 2022-10-31 at 9 PM. 
    - See my comments in [today's slides](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-slides-2022/class15.html).
    - See also my [revised Sample Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/exampleC.html) documents, this [description of what's changed since the Proposal](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2022/blob/main/projectA/changes_from_proposal.md), and the updated final report [instructions](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/report.html) and [checklist](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/check_final.html).
4. Get started on building your own website for (bonus) [Lab X](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2022/blob/main/labX.md).

## One Last Thing

- FiveThirtyEight has now paused (as of 2022-09-15) its page called [All The Science You Need To Make Your COVID-19 Decisions](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/covid-19-updates/): subtitled "We're tracking the research so you don't have to." and is no longer updating it with new guidance or science.
- The New York Times continues to update [its vaccination tracker](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html) and other tools, but hasn't updated [its COVID FAQ](https://www.nytimes.com/explain/2022/coronavirus-questions) since 2022-07-15.
- *Nature Communications* on 2022-10-12 published [Outcomes among confirmed cases and a matched comparison group in the Long-COVID in Scotland study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33415-5) by Claire E. Hastie et al., which, among other things, provides an attempt to describe the nature of long-COVID and the factors associated with it. I found this to be a really interesting article.

## Dr. Love is in a musical, "Something Rotten", which runs October 28 through November 19

[Details are here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/theater#theater) and I've been told the show may eventually sell out. A recent update is that masks will **not** be required in the audience.
