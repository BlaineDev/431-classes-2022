## Announcements

1. Feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 23 will be available **by class time**.
2. Quiz 2 grades should come to you via email by Noon on Wednesday 2022-12-07.
3. I fixed the Project B instructions so they correctly indicate December 19 at noon as the deadline for the final project reports.

## Remaining Tasks (other than Project B)

1. (*optional*) [Lab X](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2022/blob/main/labX.md) is due Monday 2022-12-12 at Noon.
2. (*optional*) Should you want Dr. Love to regrade one (or more) of Labs 1-7, please be sure to fill out the [Lab Regrade Request Form](https://bit.ly/431-2022-lab-regrade-requests), which is also due Monday 2022-12-12 at Noon.
3. (*optional*) [Lab Y](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2022/blob/main/labY.md) is **new**, and is worth a little bonus credit to you (less than Lab X, if you're choosing between them, but you can do both). It is optional, and due (submit via Canvas) on Friday 2022-12-16 at Noon.
4. CWRU will ask you to complete a course evaluation. Please do so, by their deadline.

## Project B Tasks

1. Project B **presentations** will be held on December 8, 12, 13 and 15 according to [the schedule posted here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2022/blob/main/projectB/schedule.md). 
    - Read [the Checklist](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2022/checklist.html) well in advance to make sure you complete everything you need to do and are prepared for this Oral Presentation of Results properly.
    - Zoom information for the Project B presentations is now available in the Announcements section of [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/).
    - If you're presenting to me in person, bring a laptop with the HTML or Powerpoint you want to show to me during your presentation.
2. The Project B **final reports** for [Study 1](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2022/study1b.html) and for [Study 2](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2022/study2b.html) and the [self-evaluation form](https://bit.ly/431-2022-projectB-self-evaluation) are due at noon on Monday 2022-12-19. 
    - You should submit both your [Study 1 report](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2022/study1b.html) (Rmd and HTML) and your [Study 2 report](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2022/study2b.html) (Rmd and HTML) - so a total of four documents to Canvas by that time. 
    - If you are working with a partner, exactly one of you should submit these four items. The other person should submit a one-page note to Canvas (word or PDF is best) containing your name, and stating something like “I worked on Project B with [your partner’s name] and they will submit Project B for our group.”
    - If you are working with data other than NHANES data, you will also submit your data.
3. The [Self-Evaluation for Project B Form](https://bit.ly/431-2022-projectB-self-evaluation) should take about 15 minutes to complete. If you are working in a team, each of you need to complete the form as an individual. The Form should be completed after meeting with Dr. Love for your presentation **and** after submitting your final reports to Canvas.

## One Last Thing

To come.
