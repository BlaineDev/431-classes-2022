## Announcements

1. Feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 23 [is now available](https://bit.ly/431-2022-min23-feedback).
2. You should have received at least two emails from Dr. Love since last class. If you didn't get them both, email me (or speak to me) now to let me know.
    - The first one had the subject line "431 Quiz 2 Detailed Results" and was sent Tuesday night (2022-12-06).
    - The second one had the subject line "431 Urgent: Please Check My Assessment Records" and was sent Wednesday night (2022-12-07). Note that the first poll I did on Campuswire (earlier in the semester) will be part of the Campuswire score not yet determined.
3. I fixed the Project B instructions so they correctly indicate **December 19 at noon** as the deadline for the final project reports.
4. I created a folder on our Shared Drive called "Slides from 431 Fall 2022 Classes" that includes a PDF of the first 12 sets of class slides, and another PDF of the last 12 sets. 
5. Everything in the 431 Fall 2022 Dr Love and Students Shared Drive folder will remain where it is until 2023-02-01.
6. Everything on Github including the Course Notes will remain where it is until 2023-06-01.

## Remaining Tasks (other than Project B)

1. CWRU will ask you to complete a course evaluation. Please do so, by their deadline.
2. (*optional*) [Lab X](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2022/blob/main/labX.md) is due **Monday 2022-12-12 at Noon**.
3. (*optional*) Should you want Dr. Love to regrade one (or more) of Labs 1-7, please be sure to fill out the [Lab Regrade Request Form](https://bit.ly/431-2022-lab-regrade-requests), which is also due **Monday 2022-12-12 at Noon**.
4. (*optional*) [Lab Y](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2022/blob/main/labY.md) is **new**, and is worth a little bonus credit to you (less than Lab X, if you're choosing between them, but you can do both). It is optional, and due (submit via Canvas) on **Friday 2022-12-16 at Noon**.

## Project B Tasks

1. Project B **presentations** will be held on December 8, 12, 13 and 15 according to [the schedule posted here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2022/blob/main/projectB/schedule.md). 
    - Read [the Checklist](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2022/checklist.html) well in advance to make sure you complete everything you need to do and are prepared for this Oral Presentation of Results properly.
    - Zoom information for the Project B presentations on December 12, 13 and 15 is available in the Announcements section of [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/).
    - If you're presenting to me in person, bring a laptop with the HTML or Powerpoint you want to show to me during your presentation.
2. The Project B **final reports** for [Study 1](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2022/study1b.html) and for [Study 2](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2022/study2b.html) and the [self-evaluation form](https://bit.ly/431-2022-projectB-self-evaluation) are due at noon on Monday 2022-12-19. 
    - You should submit both your [Study 1 report](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2022/study1b.html) (Rmd and HTML) and your [Study 2 report](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2022/study2b.html) (Rmd and HTML) - so a total of four documents to Canvas by that time. 
    - If you are working with a partner, exactly one of you should submit these four items. The other person should submit a one-page note to Canvas (word or PDF is best) containing your name, and stating something like “I worked on Project B with [your partner’s name] and they will submit Project B for our group.”
    - If you are working with data other than NHANES data, you will also submit your data.
3. The [Self-Evaluation for Project B Form](https://bit.ly/431-2022-projectB-self-evaluation) should take about 15 minutes to complete. If you are working in a team, each of you need to complete the form as an individual. The Form should be completed after meeting with Dr. Love for your presentation **and** after submitting your final reports to Canvas.

## One Last Thing

After today, when Dr. Love has information for you, he will post it to the [post-class page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2022/tree/main/postclass). What's there now is a description of what we'll be doing in 432, but more will appear.
