# Favorite Movies

On our Shared Google Drive in the `favorite_movies` subfolder, you'll find a data set (a Google Sheet called `movies_2021`) containing the 159 films that people taking either the 2020, 2021 or 2022 versions of 431 identified as their "Favorite Movies" in response to [the Syllabus, Section 14]([https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2021-syllabus/movies.html](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-syllabus-2022/movies.html)). For each movie, I gathered several additional characteristics from the [Internet Movie Data Base](https://www.imdb.com/) (IMDB).

## Activities involving the Movies Data
