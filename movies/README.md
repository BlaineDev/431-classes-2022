# Favorite Movies

On our Shared Google Drive in the `favorite_movies` subfolder, you'll find a data set (a Google Sheet called `movies_2021`) containing the 159 films that people taking either the 2020, 2021 or 2022 versions of 431 identified as their "Favorite Movies" in response to [the Syllabus, Section 14]([https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2021-syllabus/movies.html](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-syllabus-2022/movies.html)). For each movie, I gathered several additional characteristics from the [Internet Movie Data Base](https://www.imdb.com/) (IMDB).

## Breakout Session 1

- Here's our [first breakout activity](breakout1.md), which we went through in Class 11 (2022-10-04).
- Here are [Dr. Love's comments on that activity](breakout1_results.md) for discussion in Class 12 (2022-10-06).

## Original Data Set

The original version of the data set is called `movies_2022-09-08`. A [.csv version is available here](data/movies_2022-09-08.csv).

- [Here is a list of the 159 films](movie_list.md) in alphabetical order.
- [Here is a brief codebook](codebook1.md) describing the variables presented in the `movies_2022-09-08` file.
