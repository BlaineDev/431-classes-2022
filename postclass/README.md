# 431 Post-Class Page

When Dr. Love has information to provide to you after our final class session on 2022-12-08, you will find it on this page.

He will also email you to let you know to look for it if it's important.

Thanks.

## 432: What Will We Do?

The 432 course covers the following general topics, roughly in this order, through early April. Additional topics (for the remainder of April) will be determined later in the semester.

- Dealing with interaction and other forms of non-linearity in regression models by spending degrees of freedom on non-linear terms, particularly through the Harrell "verse".
- Using regression methods for different purposes (exploring associations, making predictions, assessing cause and effect).
- Logistic regression and generalized linear models for binary, count and multi-categorical outcomes.
- Using tidymodels approaches to build models in a more automated, tidier way, and to use more modern (robust and/or Bayesian) regression fitting strategies.
- Variable selection and its woeful performance in real situations.
- The statistical crisis in science, and how though statistical significance and p values are especially problematic, science isn’t broken.
- Retrospective assessments and issues related to sample size, especially post hoc power estimates.
- Dealing with time-to-event (survival) data, with an introduction to censoring, Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox models.
- Using sampling weights to mirror populations in modeling results (NHANES being a prime example).
- An introduction to dealing with hierarchical data, especially when confronted with repeated measures.
- Doing replicable research, and how to be a modern scientist with a web presence.

Within the realm of modeling, our linear regression work will include discussions of weighted and robust approaches, variable selection, dealing with missing data, fitting non-linear relationships through predictor transformation, cross-validation approaches, and multi-factor ANOVA and ANCOVA. In terms of logistic regression, we’ll encounter models for binary outcomes, for proportions, and for risk adjustment. We’ll also touch on models for count data and multi-categorical outcomes.
