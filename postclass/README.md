# 431 Post-Class Page

When Dr. Love has information to provide to you after our final class session on 2022-12-08, you will find it on this page.

- Everything in the 431 Fall 2022 Dr Love and Students Shared Drive folder will remain where it is until 2023-02-01.
- If you want to download one of the 431 class Zoom recordings from [Canvas], please do so before 2022-02-01. After then, most (if not all) of them will disappear.
- Everything on Github including the Course Notes will remain where it is until 2023-06-01.
Thanks.

## End of Semester Notes / Reminders

1. For your enjoyment and inspiration, our [Lab X websites are here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2022/blob/main/labXwebsites.md). I will continue to accept [Lab X submissions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2022/blob/main/labX.md) through 2022-12-19 at noon.
2. TA office hours end on 2022-12-12. [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/) will remain open until 10 AM on Monday 2022-12-19.
3. If you plan to submit [Lab Y](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2022/blob/main/labY.md), please do so by Friday 2022-12-16 at noon.
4. I posted [a tip sheet for Project B here](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2022/tipsheet.html) and also raised a few salient points on [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/) which you might want to review before submitting Project B's materials.
5. Please submit your [Project B R Markdown and HTML reports for Study 1 and Study 2](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2022/checklist.html) to [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/) by Monday 2022-12-19 at noon.
6. Please submit your Project B [self-evaluation form](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2022/self_eval.html) by Monday 2022-12-19 at noon.
7. Please complete the CWRU course evaluation form at <https://webapps.case.edu/courseevals/> by the deadline: 11:59 PM on Wed 2022-12-21.



## 432: What Will We Do?

In 431, students use R Markdown to code their work. In 432 this Spring, we'll switch that to [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

- I will provide the 432 website and syllabus to everyone enrolled in 432 about a week before the class begins on January 10. The Spring 2022 syllabus for 432 is [here](https://thomaselove.github.io/432-2022-syllabus/) but of course, things will change between now and January 10, in ways I will start to think about after 431 is complete on December 20.
- If you want to "get ahead" a bit on 432 over the break, do some work on the transition from R Markdown to [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html).

The 432 course covers the following general topics, roughly in this order, through early April. Additional topics (for the remainder of April) will be determined later in the semester.

- A review of the work we did in 431, in particular, the Project B work.
- Dealing with interaction and other forms of non-linearity in regression models by spending degrees of freedom on non-linear terms, particularly through the Harrell "verse".
- Using regression methods for different purposes (exploring associations, making predictions, assessing cause and effect).
- Logistic regression and generalized linear models for binary, count and multi-categorical outcomes.
- Using tidymodels approaches to build models in a more automated, tidier way, and to use more modern (robust and/or Bayesian) regression fitting strategies.
- Variable selection and its woeful performance in real situations.
- The statistical crisis in science, and how though statistical significance and p values are especially problematic, science isn’t broken.
- Retrospective assessments and issues related to sample size, especially post hoc power estimates.
- Dealing with time-to-event (survival) data, with an introduction to censoring, Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox models.
- Using sampling weights to mirror populations in modeling results (NHANES being a prime example).
- An introduction to dealing with hierarchical data, especially when confronted with repeated measures.
- Doing replicable research, and how to be a modern scientist with a web presence.

Within the realm of modeling, our linear regression work will include discussions of weighted and robust approaches, variable selection, dealing with missing data, fitting non-linear relationships through predictor transformation, cross-validation approaches, and multi-factor ANOVA and ANCOVA. In terms of logistic regression, we’ll encounter models for binary outcomes, for proportions, and for risk adjustment. We’ll also touch on models for count data and multi-categorical outcomes.

## The Observational Studies Course (PQHS/CRSP 500)

**500** is a project-based and more advanced course covering specific topics in the design and analysis of observational studies.

The course is mostly about using propensity scores well to help design (and analyze) data from observational studies where we want to estimate a causal effect.

- A revised syllabus for the Spring 2023 version of the course will be available on or around January 10. The Spring 2022 syllabus for 500 is [here](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-2022-syllabus/), but of course, things will change between now and January 10, in ways I will start to think about after 431 is complete on December 20.
    - I especially think MS and PhD students (in any department) interested in applications of health research in real world situations should take it, as well as people looking for jobs in fields related to health care analytics.
    - For some people, it's better to complete 432 before taking 500 for several reasons, most especially ...
        1. percolation time for some of the ideas in 431/432
        2. too much of me at one time can be overwhelming
    - If Spring 2023 is your best opportunity to take 500, then I will certainly permit you to do so. Send me an email anytime if you want to discuss this.
