07 | 2022-09-20 | **[Slides 07](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-slides-2022/class07.html)** | [Code 07](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-slides-2022/class07.qmd) | [PDF 07](431%20Class%2007.pdf) | Visit [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/), select **Zoom** and **Cloud Recordings**

- The **Reveal JS (HTML) Slides** link provides the version of the slides (in HTML) that I suggest you focus on during class.
- The Quarto file links provide the code I used (in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)) to build the slides.
- The PDF file is a nearly-complete version of the posted HTML slides in a possibly more useful format. To print RevealJS slides to pdf from the HTML Link, [follow these instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#print-to-pdf) using Google Chrome as your browser.
