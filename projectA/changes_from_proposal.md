# All of the changes from the Sample Proposal to the Sample Project A

Four different theme approaches (to get a different look) plus 25 substantive changes...

1. Clarify that main title in Project can be a maximum of 80 characters.
2. Add code to show how a subtitle can be used.
3. Your Name and Partner's Name formatting of Authors
4. Language in my instructions refers to project, not just proposal.
5. Preliminaries section now "unhides" the initial code chunk so we see loading of knitr and rmdformats
6. Initial code chunk changes max.print option to 150.
7. Change subheadings in section 1 (Preliminaries)
8. Main packages chunk now loads gt as well as janitor, naniar and tidyverse and suggests placement of other packages.
9. Clarification that Section 2.2.1 (Checking Initial Work) shouldn't be included in the final document.
10. Clarification in Section 2.3 instructions that you should select one of the listed approaches in doing your project.
11. Creation of a separate Section 2.3.5 (Quick Check) that shouldn't be included in the final document.
12. Addition of Section 2.5 (Revise order of variables) to push `county_ranked` (now actively required) to last.
13. Move new Section 2.6 (Three Important Checks) up to data development.
14. Creation of new Section 3 (Our Analytic Tibble), including ...
15. Section 3.1 Printing My Tibble (with reminders)
16. Section 3.2 Summarizing Our Tibble (with Hmisc::describe())
17. Section 3.3 Saving the Tibble
18. Section 4 now the Codebook section with separate subsections for...
19. 4.1 Table of States with County Counts (with "best practices" code)
20. 4.2 Table of Variables, Descriptions and Roles (with "best practices" code)
21. 4.3 Details on our Variables with CHR
22. Section 5 now only includes the Biggest Challenge (in developing Proposal)
23. Sections 6-8 show outline for Analyses 1-3
24. Section 9 is now Session Information
25. Additional note listed from Dr. Love (should be removed) in Section 10

Ideally, everyone will now have the 9 Sections in this revised Sample Project in their Final Project A.
