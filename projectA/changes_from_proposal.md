# All of the changes from the Sample Proposal to the Sample Project A

In creating your final project A report, we encourage you to move from using the [Sample Project A Proposal](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/exampleA.html) as a template to one of our [NEW Sample Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/exampleC.html) models.

These new Sample Project As include four different theme approaches (so you don't have to use readthedown if you don't want to) plus 25 edits. The most necessary changes for you are **listed in bold**.

1. Clarify that main title in Project can be a maximum of 80 characters.
2. Add code to show how a subtitle can be used, if you decide you want to use one.
3. Your Name and Partner's Name formatting of Authors (We'd like My Name and Your Name, rather than separating with a comma or ampersand)
4. Language in my instructions refers to project, not just proposal.
5. **Preliminaries section now "unhides" the initial code chunk** so we see loading of knitr and rmdformats 
6. **Initial code chunk changes `max.print` option to 150.**
7. **Change subheadings in section 1 (Preliminaries)**
8. Main packages chunk now loads gt as well as janitor, naniar and tidyverse and suggests placement of other packages.
9. Clarification that Section 2.2.1 (Checking Initial Work) shouldn't be included in the final document.
10. Clarification in Section 2.3 instructions that you should select one of the listed approaches in doing your project.
11. Creation of a separate Section 2.3.5 (Quick Check) that shouldn't be included in the final document.
12. Addition of **Section 2.5 (Revise order of variables) to push `county_ranked` (now actively required) to the last variable** in the tibble.
13. **Move Three Important Checks** up to data development in Section 2.6
14. Creation of **new Section 3** (Our Analytic Tibble), including ...
15. **Section 3.1** Printing My Tibble (with reminders)
16. **Section 3.2** Summarizing Our Tibble (with Hmisc::describe())
17. **Section 3.3** Saving the Tibble
18. **Section 4 now the Codebook section** with separate subsections for...
19. 4.1 Table of States with County Counts **(with "best practices" code)**
20. 4.2 Table of Variables, Descriptions and Roles **(with "best practices" code)**
21. 4.3 Details on our Variables from CHR
22. **Section 5 now only includes** the Biggest Challenge (in developing Proposal)
23. Sections 6-8 show outline for Analyses 1-3
24. Section 9 is now Session Information
25. Additional note listed from Dr. Love (should be removed) in Section 10

Ideally, everyone will now have **the same 9 Sections** in this revised Sample Project in their Final Project A.

1. Preliminaries
2. Data Development
3. Our Analytic Tibble
4. Codebook
5. Biggest Challenge
6. Analysis 1
7. Analysis 2
8. Analysis 3
9. Session Information
