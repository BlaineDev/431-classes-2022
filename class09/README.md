5. There is a lot of R material on YouTube. Today, I'll call your attention to two items in particular.
    - [Whole game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go5Au01Jrvs) by Hadley Wickham from 2018 (about 22 minutes). Hadley works in an R Markdown document and analyzes some real data.
    - [Understand the gender pay gap three ways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu2wsbIeedY) by Julia Silge (about 32 minutes). Part of a series where Julia looks at data from the [TidyTuesday project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). Check out Julia's [code for this video on her blog](https://juliasilge.com/blog/pay-gap-uk/).
    - [How to copy website table data to R with the datapasta package](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAkfDQgghzk) by Lyndon Walker (about 6 minutes.) Lyndon demonstrates the use of [the `datapasta` package](https://github.com/MilesMcBain/datapasta).
6. Quiz 1 looms. I will provide you with a copy of the (general) instructions for the Quiz as part of Class 10, so you'll have a better understanding of what is ahead of you.

## One Last Thing

From [Flowing Data](https://flowingdata.com/2022/09/19/oldest-u-s-government/): A note on "[Oldest U.S. Government](https://flowingdata.com/2022/09/19/oldest-u-s-government/)" from 2022-09-19. Here, we are guided towards the straightforward [charts from Annie Fu, Walt Hickey and Shayanne Gal at Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/gerontocracy-united-states-congress-red-white-and-gray-data-charts-2022-9). Two examples follow:
