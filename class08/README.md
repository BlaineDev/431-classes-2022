08 | 2022-09-22 | **[Slides 08](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-slides-2022/class08.html)** | [Code 08](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-slides-2022/class08.qmd) | [PDF 08](431%20Class%2008.pdf) | Visit [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/), select **Zoom** and **Cloud Recordings**

- The **Reveal JS (HTML) Slides** link provides the version of the slides (in HTML) that I suggest you focus on during class.
- The Quarto file links provide the code I used (in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)) to build the slides.
- The PDF file is a nearly-complete version of the posted HTML slides in a possibly more useful format. To print RevealJS slides to pdf from the HTML Link, [follow these instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#print-to-pdf) using Google Chrome as your browser.

## Announcements

1. Is it possible to turn off the lights directly above the screen? Let's **give it a try**.
2. I corrected a typo (I had 2021, when I meant 2022) in the [Lab 02 instructions pdf](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2022/blob/main/lab02.pdf) on Wednesday 2022-09-21. 
3. [Feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 07](https://bit.ly/431-2022-min07-feedback) is now available. Thank you all for completing this on time, and thanks again to those of you who said nice things about the course so far. I appreciate it.
4. **Looking for a Project A partner?** I posted a pinned note to Campuswire, where you can add your name to the Comments if you're still looking for a Project A partner, and identify other people looking for a partner from the list.
5. Link to [RStudio's Cheat Sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) is always useful.
6. I shared a couple of the many nice essays written in response to Questions 2 and 3 from Lab 01 on our Shared Drive, in the Lab Sketches and Rubrics |> Lab 01 folder. Thanks to the (unnamed here) authors.

## Where are we in the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/)?

So far, we've discussed 

- almost all of the material discussed in Chapters 1-8, 
- some of the missing data materials in Chapter 9, (but not yet simple imputation) 
- most of what's discussed in Chapter 10 and Chapter 11, (but not yet much on transformations)
- and part of what's covered in Chapters 12-17.

We'll get through most of the rest of Chapters 1-17 by the end of Class 12, when Quiz 1 will become available. My best advice for how to prepare for Quiz 1 at this time is to complete your Project A proposal.

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. Read Chapter 3 (Why are we looking at data anyway? Populations and measurement) of Spiegelhalter's *The Art of Statistics*.
2. Read the Minute Paper and Lab 1 feedback provided this week.
3. [Lab 02](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2022), due Monday at 9 PM.
4. Work on selecting and cleaning [your data for Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/data.html), and then move on to building the [Project A proposal](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/proposal.html) (early deadline: 2022-10-03 at Noon.)
5. You should also be able to do most of [Lab 03](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2022) at this point, which is also due Monday 2022-10-03, but at 9 PM. You'll need to have read Chapter 4 of Spiegelhalter.
6. If you haven't recently [updated your R packages](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/software.html#updating-your-r-packages), now would be a good time.
