## Announcements

1. I've gently tweaked [Lab 7's instructions (pdf)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2022/blob/main/lab07.pdf) and [data set (.xls)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data/blob/main/lab07_trial.xls) to make things easier and clearer for you when doing that Lab (it's due right after Thanksgiving.)
2. Remember we don't have class next Tuesday (2022-11-08) because of Election Day. Instead, Class 18 will be pre-recorded, and I'll make that available to you **as soon as possible**.
3. The status of Project A submissions [is summarized here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2022/blob/main/projectA/submission_status.md). Please check Canvas and your email for details if an issue is indicated.
    > In both speech and writing, among and amongst are interchangeable. Both are grammatically correct and mean the same thing. However, amongst is often considered old-fashioned or pretentious in American English, so you may want to avoid it.

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. The Minute Paper for this week is due Friday at noon, and is available at https://bit.ly/431-2022-min-17.
2. [Lab 5](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2022) is due Monday 2022-11-07 at 9 PM.
3. The [Project B registration form](https://bit.ly/431-projB-registration-2022) is due at 5 PM on Friday 2022-11-11. This form will be all you need to obtain my approval for your plan, let me know if youâ€™re working with a partner, and schedule your oral presentation. 
    - This deadline will not change, and you need to start Project B this weekend if you haven't already. 
    - We'll spend a few minutes talking about [Project B](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2022/). Specifically, we'll talk about the [five things you need to do to be able to register your work](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2022/register.html#what-do-you-need-to-do-before-filling-out-the-form).
