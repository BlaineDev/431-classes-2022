## How To Share Data with a Statistician

[How to share data with a statistician](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing) from Jeff Leek's group continues to be an excellent resource that is well worth your time. You should see in it some of the motivation for the elements of the [Project A proposal](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/).

## Announcements

1. Feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 09 will be available by class time.
2. A nearly final draft of the [Quiz 1 instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-quizzes-2022/blob/main/quiz1) is now posted.
    - All elements of the actual Quiz [will be available](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-quizzes-2022/blob/main/quiz1) at 5 PM next Thursday 2022-10-06, and Quiz 1 is due 2022-10-10 at 9 PM.
3. Dr. Love prepared a [Sample Quiz](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-quizzes-2022/tree/main/sample) containing five old quiz questions, as well as an answer sketch for those five questions, and some information on results. [You'll find it all here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-quizzes-2022/tree/main/sample), if you are interested.
4. There is a lot of R material on YouTube. Today, I'll call your attention to two items in particular.
    - [How to copy website table data to R with the datapasta package](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAkfDQgghzk) by Lyndon Walker (about 6 minutes.) Lyndon demonstrates the use of [the `datapasta` package](https://github.com/MilesMcBain/datapasta).
    - [Multiple linear regression with interaction in R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJnHmCMb1q4) from Equitable Equations uses the `palmerpenguins` data to demonstrate the use of interaction terms for categorical variables in R, which we'll be doing in Class 11 next Tuesday. The video is just under 10 minutes long.

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. Lab 03 is due Monday 2022-10-03 at 9 PM.
2. Read Spiegelhalter Chapter 4 (What Causes What?)
3. Work on your [Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/) Proposal (early deadline is Monday 2022-10-03 at NOON.)
4. Now would be a good time to [update your R packages](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/software.html#updating-your-r-packages)
