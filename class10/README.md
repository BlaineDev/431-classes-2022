## How To Share Data with a Statistician

[How to share data with a statistician](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing) from Jeff Leek's group continues to be an excellent resource that is well worth your time. You should see in it some of the motivation for the elements of the [Project A proposal](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/).

## Announcements

1. Feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 09 [is now available](https://bit.ly/431-2022-min09-feedback). Thanks for completing the form, everyone!
2. Since the audio stopped after 13 minutes of Class 08, I built a brief (11 minute) re-recording, where I (very quickly) walk through all of the Class 08 slides. You should find this (called **431 Class 08 (brief re-recording)**) in the Zoom link on our [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu) page.
3. We have adjusted the Zoom information for the Saturday 7:00 to 8:30 PM TA office hours so that we'll (we hope) no longer have technical problems with that session.
4. I made a mistake in trying to correct Lab 03 on Tuesday evening, but fixed it back to the original plan on Wednesday afternoon. Here's the link to [the correct PDF of Lab 3 instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2022/blob/main/lab03.pdf).
    - The value for Cuyahoga County's `adult_obesity` should be 0.318, but the value we're interested in is the mean across all 750 sampled counties, which is 0.3345. 
    - If you are getting a warning message when you try to pull in the `lab03_counties.csv` data, you might want to pull it down again from [431-data](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data). There was an issue with how the missing values appeared which shouldn't have affected you, but might have. The version posted to [431-data](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data) now has no such issues.
5. I've revised (slightly) the [Lab 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data/blob/main/YOURNAME-lab02.Rmd) and [Lab 3](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data/blob/main/YOURNAME-lab03.Rmd) templates, to eliminate the use of `include = FALSE` which seems to be causing problems. Get the new ones at [431-data](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data).    
6. An essentially final draft of the [Quiz 1 instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-quizzes-2022/blob/main/quiz1) is now posted.
    - All elements of the actual Quiz [will be available](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-quizzes-2022/blob/main/quiz1) at 5 PM next Thursday 2022-10-06, and Quiz 1 is due 2022-10-10 at 9 PM. 
7. Dr. Love prepared a [Sample Quiz](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-quizzes-2022/tree/main/sample) containing five old quiz questions, as well as an answer sketch for those five questions, and some information on results. [You'll find it all here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-quizzes-2022/tree/main/sample), if you are interested.
8. There is a lot of R material on YouTube. Today, I'll call your attention to two items in particular.
    - [How to copy website table data to R with the datapasta package](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAkfDQgghzk) by Lyndon Walker (about 6 minutes.) Lyndon demonstrates the use of [the `datapasta` package](https://github.com/MilesMcBain/datapasta).
    - [Multiple linear regression with interaction in R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJnHmCMb1q4) from Equitable Equations uses the `palmerpenguins` data to demonstrate the use of interaction terms for categorical variables in R, which we'll be doing in Class 11 next Tuesday. The video is just under 10 minutes long.

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. [Lab 03](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2022) is due Monday 2022-10-03 at 9 PM.
2. Work on your [Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/) Proposal (early deadline is Monday 2022-10-03 at NOON.)
3. Read Spiegelhalter Chapter 4 (What Causes What?)
4. Now would be a good time to [update your R packages](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/software.html#updating-your-r-packages), and maybe take a look at the Quiz 1 instructions (and sample Quiz) I mentioned above.
