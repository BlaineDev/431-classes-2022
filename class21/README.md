## What Should I Be Working On?

1. [Lab 7](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2022) is due Monday 2022-11-28 (Monday after Thanksgiving) at 9 PM. You can do it now.
2. Spiegehalter, Chapter 10 is required reading for Lab 7, but you should really finish the book before you turn in Quiz 2.
3. [Project B](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2022/) should be something you can essentially complete over the Thanksgiving Break, and doing so provides the best possible review of materials for Quiz 2.
    - If nothing else, I strongly encourage you to read [the Checklist page from the Project B instructions](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2022/checklist.html), before too much more time has passed.
4. Quiz 2 will be available to you late in the evening on Tuesday 2022-11-29, and is due at 9 PM on Monday 2022-12-05.

## One Last Thing

To come.
