## Announcements

1. Since we weren't able to record Class 01, I created a brief summary recording (5-6 minutes long) which you can watch, listen to, or download by visiting [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu) and then selecting **Zoom**, then **Cloud Recordings** and selecting the Class 01 Summary recording.
2. We're making every effort to record all subsequent classes in their entirety, which will be posted to the same place, in theory.

## Ten Things To Do After Class 01 (if you haven't, already)

1. Bookmark and familiarize yourself with the [main course website](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/), being sure to visit the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/calendar.html) and see what's ahead of you.
2. Read through the [Course Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-syllabus-2022/).
3. Obtain David Spiegelhalter's *The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data* (~$20), and read the Introduction.
    - Our [Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/calendar.html) provides reading lists on weekends, anticipating that you'll complete the suggested reading before the next class.
4. Complete the [Welcome to 431 survey](https://bit.ly/431-2022-welcome-survey), if you haven't yet. Thanks if you've already done this.
5. Get started [installing the software](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/software.html) you'll need.
6. Sign up for the (free) [Campuswire discussion forum](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/campuswire.html).
7. Take a look at the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/). Part A is now a complete version.
8. You should also bookmark [Introduction to Modern Statistics](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/) and [R for Data Science, 2nd ed.](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/). Each of these books is very useful. I would also bookmark the [RStudio Cheat Sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) page.
9. Ask us questions. TA office hours start next Tuesday, but [Campuswire is available now](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/campuswire.html).
10. Take a look at [Lab 01 (due 2022-09-12)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2022) which is your first substantial deliverable. 


## One Last Thing
