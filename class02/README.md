## Announcements

1. Since we weren't able to record Class 01, I created a brief summary recording (5-6 minutes long) which you can watch, listen to, or download by visiting [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu) and then selecting **Zoom**, then **Cloud Recordings** and selecting the Class 01 Summary recording.
2. We're making every effort to record all subsequent classes in their entirety, which will be posted to the same place, in theory.

## Things to Do This Weekend

1. Bookmark the [main course website](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/), and the books [R for Data Science, 2nd ed.](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) and [Introduction to Modern Statistics](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/) as well as the [RStudio Cheat Sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) page.
2. Read through the [Course Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-syllabus-2022/). Hint: I'll know on Tuesday morning if you've done this.
3. Read the introduction and perhaps Chapter 1 of Spiegelhalter's *The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data*
4. [Install the software](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/software.html) and R packages you'll need.
5. Sign up for the (free) [Campuswire discussion forum](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/campuswire.html) if you haven't already.
6. Ask us questions. TA office hours start next Tuesday, but [Campuswire is available now](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/campuswire.html).
7. Take a look at the following items...

    - the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/calendar.html), 
    - the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/) (where, as mentioned, I would try to skim from the start through Chapter 3),
    - and at your first substantial assignment: [Lab 01 (due 2022-09-12)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2022).



## One Last Thing

To come.
