## Thursday December 15

- Email Dr. Love with any day-of-presentation emergencies.
- If you feel ill or have been exposed to something, do not attend in-person, but instead email Dr. Love to let him know you'll instead present via Zoom.

### If you are presenting in person

- Please arrive at Dr. Love's office **10 minutes prior** to the start time listed below. If his door is open, knock and let him know you're there. If it's closed, please don't knock - just wait until he opens the door. Thank you.
- I've moved all of the Thursday afternoon sessions originally planned as in-person to Zoom. Sorry.
- Dr. Loveâ€™s office at CWRU is on the ground floor of the Wood building (in the WG-82 Suite), specifically it is **WG-82J**.
