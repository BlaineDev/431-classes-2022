#### Notes on Accepted NHANES Projects

1. Be sure you restrict your sample to adults ages 21-79, or to some other very specific group (children ages 6-18, or women ages 18-55, for example). That should be accomplished with a simple filter immediately after you ingest the data, and you should **not** use the subjects with age listed as 80.
2. Be sure that you verify that your data does not contain any duplicate SEQN values after you've joined all of the files together. It shouldn't, but it's worth a check. If it does, you've made a mistake in creating your data, and you'll want to discuss this with a TA or share your R Markdown with the TAs and Instructor on Campuswire before the Thanksgiving break.
3. If the variable name and data set name Dr. Love has listed above doesn't match your plans, contact him via email immediately. Be sure to check the NHANES documentation for each of your variables to ensure that you understand the age range where the data were collected.
4. In your codebook, start with this statement (filling in your pieces as appropriate):

> The NHANES dataset combines interviews and physical examinations from adults and children in the United States using surveys examining a nationally representative sample of about 5,000 persons each year. In (my/our) work, we used data from the 2017 - March 2020 survey period, and from the following data sets: Demographics (P-DEMO), and [list next data source, with P-XXXX name], and [list next data source, with P-XXXX name]. [If appropriate, you should then specify any restrictions on your data, perhaps to adults (specify your age range, which is usually 21-79 - do not use the 80-year old subjects) or to children and/or to people with a particular condition.)]
