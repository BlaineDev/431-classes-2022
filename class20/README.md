## If you are using NHANES data in your project B, here's how I'd like you to describe the source of your data as part of your codebook in Study 1 and Study 2.

> The NHANES dataset combines interviews and physical examinations from adults and children in the United States using a nationally representative sample of about 5,000 persons each year. In (my/our) work, we used data from the 2017 - March 2020 survey period, and from the following data sets: Demographics (P-DEMO), and [list next data source, with P-XXXX name], and [list next data source, with P-XXXX name]. [Next, you should in a sentence then specify any restrictions on your data, perhaps to adults (specify your age range) or people with a particular condition. - an example would be "We restricted our sample to the XXXX individuals between the ages of 21 and 79, who had been told by a physician that they had diabetes, and who had complete data on the variables listed in our codebook."]
