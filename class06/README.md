## Announcements

1. Detailed instructions for [Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/) are [now available](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/).
    - You can work alone, or with one other person on Project A. If you work as a pair, you create one project together, and each of you receive the same grade.
    - You can *and should* get started on the [Data and Proposal](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/) materials now. All of that work can (and should, ideally) be completed in September. The Analyses and Final Report will be done in October.
    - We'll give you a few minutes **today** to chat with others and decide if you might like to work as partners.
2. Feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 05 will be available by class time.

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. This weekend would be a good time to [update your R packages](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/software.html#updating-your-r-packages), and be sure you re-pull down the materials on our [431-data page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data).
2. Read Spiegelhalter through Chapter 2.
3. Read through the [Project A instructions](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/) and get started on selecting and cleaning your [Data](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/data.html) so you can build your [Proposal](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/proposal.html) in time for the early deadline on 2022-11-03 at noon you'll find in the [Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/calendar.html).
4. [Lab 02](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2022) is due Monday 2022-09-26 at 9 PM.
