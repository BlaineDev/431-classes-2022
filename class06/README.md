## Announcements

1. Detailed instructions for [Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/) are [now available](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/).
    - You can work alone, or with one other person on Project A. If you work as a pair, you create one project together, and each of you receive the same grade.
    - You can *and should* get started on the [Data and Proposal](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/) materials now. All of that work can (and should, ideally) be completed in September. The Analyses and Final Report will be done in October.
    - We'll give you a few minutes today to chat with others and decide if you might like to work as partners.
2. Feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 05 will be available by class time.

## One Last Thing
