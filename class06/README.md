## Announcements

1. Note that I revised the slides for Classes 05 and 06 a bit, and we'll discuss that today. 
    - I also posted the `dm431.csv` file to our [431-data page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data) and to the [data folder on this Class 06 page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2022/tree/main/class06/data). 
2. Feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 05 [is now available](https://bit.ly/431-2022-min05-feedback).
3. The [Writing Resource Center is up and running again](https://case.edu/artsci/writing/resources/writing-center/online-tutoring). 
    - The centerâ€™s team is available to help all undergraduate and graduate students, as well as faculty and staff, and both in-person and online appointments can be made by [going here](https://case.mywconline.com/). If you have questions, email them at `writingcenter` at `case` dot `edu`.
    - They can help with everything from homework assignments to competitive funding applications and even articles for publication. 
    - Some past PQHS students have attributed enormous improvement in their writing over the years to help they got from the WRC. 

## Project A: Getting Started

As you know, detailed instructions for [Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/) are [now available](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/). You can *and should* get started on the [Data and Proposal](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/) materials now. All of that work can (and should, ideally) be completed in September. The Analyses and Final Report will be done in October. See my comments below on how to get started.

1. Remember that it is possible (but not in any way mandatory) to work with a partner on Project A. 
    - If you work with a partner, you can split up the tasks but each of you will need to understand everything that is submitted, and you should each be doing approximately one-half of the work. There are advantages and disadvantages to working on this project with a partner.
    - You can work alone, or with one other person on Project A. If you work as a pair, you create one project together, and each of you receive the same grade.
    - We'll give you a few minutes **today** to chat with others and decide if you might like to work as partners.

2. The first step after reading the Project A instructions is to create a **new project directory** on your computer where you'll put all of your materials for Project A.
    - We then suggest you put all of the relevant information into that directory, specifically, the [three files listed here](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/data.html).
    - You'll also want to put the [R Markdown file for the Project A Proposal example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-projectA-sample-proposal/blob/main/love_sample_projA_proposal.Rmd) in that directory, and you'll wind up adjusting this to create your own R Markdown file.

3. Start building the R Markdown file in which you will do your work. We suggest you make a copy of [the R Markdown file for the Project A Proposal example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-projectA-sample-proposal/blob/main/love_sample_projA_proposal.Rmd) and use that as your template. 
    - Be sure to change the name of the R Markdown file to suit your situation, and also to fill in your name, etc. in the YAML code at the top of the R Markdown document. Do this first so you don't forget.
    - Remember also to delete the instructions from Dr. Love before submitting anything to Canvas.

4. Ingest the County Health Rankings 2022 data into R, and here we suggest you follow the [instructions on the Project A data page for Task 1](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/data.html).

5. Work your way through the remaining Tasks (2 - 7) described in the [Project A Data page](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/data.html). 
    - This will leave you with a complete and tidy tibble which you will have saved (into an .Rds file) and summarized, along with a codebook in an R Markdown document. 
    - Use the [Project A proposal example](https://rpubs.com/TELOVE/projA-sample-proposal-431-2022) to help see what you need to do.

6. Now move on to the [Project A Proposal page](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/proposal.html) and complete the requirements described there. 
    - Again, use the [Project A Proposal Example](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/exampleA.html) as a template for your work.

7. If you have questions, [visit TA office hours](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/contact.html) (ideally) or, if that's not possible, use the [projectA folder on Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/).

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. This weekend would be a good time to [update your R packages](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/software.html#updating-your-r-packages), and be sure you re-pull down the materials on our [431-data page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data).
2. Read Spiegelhalter through Chapter 2.
3. Read through the [Project A instructions](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/) and get started on selecting and cleaning your [Data](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/data.html) so you can build your [Proposal](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/proposal.html) in time for the early deadline on 2022-11-03 at noon you'll find in the [Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/calendar.html).
4. [Lab 02](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2022) is due Monday 2022-09-26 at 9 PM. You should be mostly able to do this Lab, although completion of Lab 02 requires you to have read through Chapter 3 of Spiegelhalter's The Art of Statistics.
