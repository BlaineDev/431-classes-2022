## Announcements

1. Detailed instructions for [Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/) are [now available](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/).
    - You can work alone, or with one other person on Project A. If you work as a pair, you create one project together, and each of you receive the same grade.
    - You can *and should* get started on the [Data and Proposal](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/) materials now. All of that work can (and should, ideally) be completed in September. The Analyses and Final Report will be done in October.
    - We'll give you a few minutes **today** to chat with others and decide if you might like to work as partners.
2. Feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 05 will be available by class time.
3. The [Writing Resource Center is up and running again](https://case.edu/artsci/writing/resources/writing-center/online-tutoring)). 
    - The center’s team is available to help all undergraduate and graduate students, as well as faculty and staff, and both in-person and online appointments can be made by [going here](https://case.mywconline.com/). If you have questions, email them at `writingcenter` at `case` dot `edu`.
    - They can help with everything from homework assignments to competitive funding applications and even articles for publication. 
    - Some past PQHS students have attributed enormous improvement in their writing over the years to help they got from the WRC. 

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. This weekend would be a good time to [update your R packages](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/software.html#updating-your-r-packages), and be sure you re-pull down the materials on our [431-data page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data).
2. Read Spiegelhalter through Chapter 2.
3. Read through the [Project A instructions](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/) and get started on selecting and cleaning your [Data](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/data.html) so you can build your [Proposal](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/proposal.html) in time for the early deadline on 2022-11-03 at noon you'll find in the [Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/calendar.html).
4. [Lab 02](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2022) is due Monday 2022-09-26 at 9 PM. You should be mostly able to do this Lab, although completion of Lab 02 requires you to have read through Chapter 3 of Spiegelhalter's The Art of Statistics.
