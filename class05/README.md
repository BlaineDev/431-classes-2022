## Announcements

1. There is a [Minute Paper after Class 05](https://bit.ly/431-2022-min-05), which you'll need to complete by NOON Wednesday 2022-09-14.
2. An answer sketch for Lab 01 will be available by class time.
3. Detailed instructions for [Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/) are [now available](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/).
    - Project A is the first of two real data science projects you’ll be doing this semester. For Project A, Professor Love will give you a lot of information but less flexibility than you’ll have in Project B. In particular, you’ll each be working with part of the same data set (the County Health Rankings 2022 data.) The three key analytic tasks you’ll complete are:
        - Visualizing and modeling the relationship between a quantitative outcome and a quantitative predictor.
        - Visualizing and modeling the relationship between a quantitative outcome and a categorical predictor (with 2-5 levels).
        - Visualizing and modeling the relationship between a quantitative outcome and a quantitative predictor, after adjustment for the state in which the county is located
        - You can work alone, or with one other person on Project A. If you work as a pair, you create one project together, and each of you receive the same grade.
    - You can get started on the [Data and Proposal](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectA-2022/) materials now. All of that work can (and should, ideally) be completed in September. The Analyses and Final Report will be done in October.
    - We'll give you a few minutes in Class 06 to chat with others and decide if you might like to work as partners.
4. We have updated the [Lab 2 instructions (fixing the hint)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2022), and also the [templates for Labs 2 and 3](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data). Grab the latest versions to avoid some confusion. 
5. One last batch of a dozen interesting or fun facts that you included in the [Welcome to 431 Survey](https://bit.ly/431-2022-welcome-survey).
    - I love folklore/mythology/fairy tales, and SCUBA diving.
    - I love to drive to discount furniture stores.
    - I sang at the Sistine Chapel.
    - I used to be a firefighter and my spouse and I left our wedding in a fire engine.
    - I used to compete in national Yo-Yo competitions.
    - I'm an extra in a movie.
    - I'm a severe sleepwalker.
    - I love playing Ping-Pong.
    - My spouse and I met in college Marching Band.
    - I was awarded a scholarship to culinary school.
    - I went glass-bottom kayaking in the Florida Keys earlier this summer where I saw so much marine life and different varieties of plants and fish.
    - I started (and continue to run) a social media platform on Instagram and Tiktok to convey fast, easy, accurate, humble and free-of-charge medical information, speaking in Lebanese so it can be accessible for all the Arab world.

## One Last Thing

The FiveThirtyEight website has a lot of interesting data projects going on. Take a minute to look at "[60 Percent Of Americans Will Have An Election Denier On The Ballot This Fall](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/republicans-trump-election-fraud/)"
