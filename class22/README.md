## Announcements

1. Lab 6 Grades and Feedback are now available on the [Course Grades Roster](https://bit.ly/431-grades-2022).
2. Three nice essays from Question 6 in Lab 6 are posted to [our Shared Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aqcxNcmUy1BTdV5a3Ocvbgau2aJshX9DCl_l5siPe_I/edit?usp=share_link)
3. The Answer Sketch and Grading Rubric for Lab 7 will be posted **by class time**.
4. Some of you have yet to read carefully [the instructions for Project B](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2022/), in particular the very important [Checklist](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2022/checklist.html).
5. Remember that we will not have class on Thursday 2022-12-01. 
    - Instead, I will hold a Zoom-only Ask Me Anything session from 1:00 to 2:00 PM on Thursday 2022-12-01, which appears in the regular Zoom section of [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu) and in an email I sent to you on Monday 2022-11-28. 
    - I will record the Ask Me Anything session and make it available to you all, so you don't have to join if you don't have any questions of your own to ask.
6. Zoom information for the Project B presentations is now available in the Announcements section of [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/). The Project B [schedule of presentations is here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2022/blob/main/projectB/schedule.md).

## Remaining Deadlines

1. Our second and final Quiz will be available to you **before midnight tonight** (2022-11-29). You'll receive an email from Dr. Love with a link to the materials you'll need as soon as everything is ready for you. The Quiz is due on Monday 2022-12-05 at 9 PM.
2. We will have a Minute Paper after Class 23 due Wednesday 2022-12-07, but there is no minute paper this week.
3. Those of you who are in any way disappointed with your grade in the course so far, **or** who are looking to continue working in or studying statistics and data science past the 431-432 sequence, should definitely be working on [Lab X](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2022/blob/main/labX.md), which is due Monday 2022-12-12 at Noon.
4. Should you want Dr. Love to regrade one (or more) of Labs 1-7, please be sure to fill out the [Lab Regrade Request Form](https://bit.ly/431-2022-lab-regrade-requests), which is also due Monday 2022-12-12 at Noon.
5. Project B presentations will be held on December 8, 12, 13 and 15 according to [the schedule posted here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2022/blob/main/projectB/schedule.md). 
    - Zoom information for the Project B presentations is now available in the Announcements section of [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/).
    - Read [the Checklist](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2022/checklist.html) well in advance to make sure you complete everything you need to do and are prepared for this Oral Presentation of Results properly.
6. The Project B final reports for [Study 1](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2022/study1b.html) and for [Study 2](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2022/study2b.html) and the [self-evaluation form](https://bit.ly/431-2022-projectB-self-evaluation) are due at noon on Monday 2022-12-19. Read [the Checklist](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2022/checklist.html) well in advance to make sure you complete everything you need to do.
    - You should submit both your [Study 1 report](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2022/study1b.html) (Rmd and HTML) and your [Study 2 report](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-projectB-2022/study2b.html) (Rmd and HTML) - so a total of four documents to Canvas by that time. 
    - If you are working with a partner, exactly one of you should submit these four items. The other person should submit a one-page note to Canvas (word or PDF is best) containing your name, and stating something like “I worked on Project B with [your partner’s name] and they will submit Project B for our group.”
    - If you are working with data other than NHANES data, you will also submit your data.
    - The [Self-Evaluation for Project B Form](https://bit.ly/431-2022-projectB-self-evaluation) should take about 15 minutes to complete. If you are working in a team, each of you need to complete the form as an individual. The Form should be completed after meeting with Dr. Love for your presentation **and** after submitting your final reports to Canvas.
