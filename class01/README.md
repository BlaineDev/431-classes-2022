## Announcements

1. Thank you to those of you who've completed the [Welcome to 431 Survey](https://bit.ly/431-2022-welcome-survey). 
    - If you haven't completed this yet, please do so as soon as possible. Dr. Love will discuss the Survey results once they are complete.
    - If you are not yet enrolled in this class, please talk to me before you leave this room. We're full here, but there is a Section 2 from 4:00 - 5:15 on Tuesdays and Thursdays. 

2. We'll start today on [the main page](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/) for the course, and look over:

- the [Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2021-syllabus/)
- the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/) (main text for the course)
- the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html), which is the final word for all deadlines in this course
- the Assignments, including the [first Lab](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/master/labs/lab01/lab01.md)
- the information available on [getting R and R Studio](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/software_install.html) and some [R packages](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/r_packages.html) installed on your computer, as well as some of [the data we'll be using](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data).
- the [Piazza discussion forum](https://piazza.com/case/fall2021/pqhs431) for the class, and other ways you can get help from us
    - [Piazza](https://piazza.com/case/fall2021/pqhs431) is the best place to ask (and answer) questions outside of class time, especially before TA office hours begin on 2020-08-29.
- the [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/) page for the course
    - We use [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/) as a place to: set up and store Zoom class recordings, maintain the TA office hours Zoom schedule, and turn in assignments. That's it.
- the Shared Google Drive for the course, which you should find listed as **431 Fall 2021 Dr Love and Students** on your CWRU Google Drive. At the moment, it contains the TA office hours schedule and Zoom links for those office hours.

3. RStudio's [incredibly useful Cheat Sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) had a [major update announced on 2021-08-23](https://blog.rstudio.com/2021/08/23/cheat-sheet-updates/). Many RStudio cheatsheets have been updated or reworked based on recent package updates.

## Ten Things To Do After Class

1. Complete the [Welcome to 431 Survey](https://bit.ly/431-2021-welcome-survey) if you haven't done so already. 
2. Read the [Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2021-syllabus/) and do what it asks you to do. It's very long.
3. Bookmark and familiarize yourself with the [Main Page](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/) for the course, especially the [Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html) of deadlines, and take a look at the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/).
4. Follow the R and Data instructions to [install R and R Studio](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/software_install.html), and get the necessary [R Packages](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/r_packages.html) and [431 Data downloads](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/data_index.html) onto your computer.
5. Obtain David Spiegelhalter's [The Art of Statistics](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Statistics-How-Learn-Data/dp/1541618513) and start reading. Our [Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html) provides reading lists most on Fridays, anticipating that you'll complete the suggested reading before the next class.
6. You should also bookmark [Introduction to Modern Statistics](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/) and [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and see the [Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html) for suggested readings in those books.
7. I would also bookmark the [RStudio Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) page, and perhaps our detailed list of [R Tutorials](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/software/README.md).
8. Make note of how to access [TA office hours](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/contact.html) (those start 2020-08-27) - details are found on our Shared Google Drive. Be sure your version of Zoom through CWRU is up to date.
9. Ask us questions. TA office hours start next week, but [Piazza is available now](https://piazza.com/case/fall2021/pqhs431).
10. Take a look at [Lab 01 (due 2020-09-06)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/labs/lab01) which is your first substantial deliverable. If you like, you can also look at the [instructions for Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/projects.html), but we'll talk about that in a couple of weeks.
