# 431 Class 01: 2022-08-30

- This is the README for Class 01 of Professor Love's 431 course for Fall 2021. 
- Each class' README serves as a **starting point** for that class session.

## How do I get to this README page?

The main website for this class is https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/. From that site, get here by 

- selecting [Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/calendar.html)
- then select today's class ([Class 01: 2021-08-24](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-22/tree/main/class01)).
