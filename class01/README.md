# 431 Class 01: 2022-08-30

## As you walk in...

Be sure to get one of the "*A Convenient Piece of Paper*" handouts. **Don't** write on it yet. Instead, get to know those around you.

## This is the README page for Class 01.

- Each class' README serves as a starting point for that class session.

The main website for this class is https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/. From that site, get to this README by 

- selecting [Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/calendar.html)
- then selecting today's class (Class 01). Direct Link: https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-classes-2022/tree/main/class01

## Announcements

1. Thank you to those of you who've completed the [Welcome to 431 Survey](https://bit.ly/431-2022-welcome-survey). 
    - If you haven't completed this yet, please do so as soon as possible. Dr. Love will discuss the Survey results once they are complete.
    - If you are not yet enrolled in this class, please talk to me before you leave this room. 
        - We're full here, but there is a Section 2 from 4:00 - 5:15 on Tuesdays and Thursdays. 

2. As part of our slides today, we'll visit [the main course page](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/) for the course, and look over:

- the [Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-syllabus-2022/)
- the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/) (main text for the course)
- the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/calendar.html), which is the final word for all deadlines in this course
- the [Assignments](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/assignments.html), including the [first Lab](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2022)
- the information available on [getting R and R Studio](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/software.html#installing-r-and-r-studio) and some [R packages and data sets](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/software.html#installing-r-packages-and-datacode-for-431) installed on your computer.
- the [Campuswire discussion forum](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/campuswire.html) for the class, and other [ways you can get help from us](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/contact.html)
    - [Campuswire](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/campuswire.html) is the best place to ask (and answer) questions outside of class time.
    - TA Office Hours will begin on Tuesday 2022-09-06. All are held via Zoom. We'll get a schedule to you as soon as possible.
- the [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/) page for the course, which we use only as a place to turn in some assignments.
- the Shared Google Drive for the course, which you should find listed as **431 Fall 2022 Dr Love and Students** on your CWRU Google Drive. At the moment, it contains nothing of particular importance, but that will change.

3. RStudio's [incredibly useful Cheat Sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) are a great source of help, too.

## Ten Things To Do After Class 01 (if you haven't, already)

1. Bookmark and familiarize yourself with the [main course website](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/), being sure to visit the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/calendar.html) and see what's ahead of you.
2. Read through the [Course Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-syllabus-2022/).
3. Obtain David Spiegelhalter's *The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data* (~$20), and read the Introduction.
    - Our [Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html) provides reading lists on weekends, anticipating that you'll complete the suggested reading before the next class.
4. Complete the [Welcome to 431 survey](https://bit.ly/431-2022-welcome-survey). Thanks if you've already done this.
5. Get started [installing the software](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/software.html) you'll need.
6. Sign up for the (free) [Campuswire discussion forum](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/campuswire.html).
7. Take a look at the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/). Part A is now a complete version.
8. You should also bookmark [Introduction to Modern Statistics](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/) and [R for Data Science, 2nd ed.](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/). Each of these books is very useful. I would also bookmark the [RStudio Cheat Sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) page.
9. Ask us questions. TA office hours start next Tuesday, but [Campuswire is available now](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/campuswire.html).
10. Take a look at [Lab 01 (due 2022-09-12)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-labs-2022) which is your first substantial deliverable.
